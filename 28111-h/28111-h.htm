<p class="pr1"><big><b>Beyond the false windows she could see the reddish
wasteland where dust clouds spun and shifted so slowly.</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">She had</span> been asleep.
Now she stretched luxuriously
beneath the crisp white
sheet that the vapid August
heat decreed. From memory
to memory her dream-fogged
mind drifted, and to the yet-to-be.
It was good to remember,
and to imagine, and to
see and feel and hear....</p>

<p>She smiled. She was Ruth
Halsey, fourteen, brunette,
and pretty. Earl, and Harry,
and Buhl had told her she was
pretty. Especially Buhl. Buhl
was her favorite date now.</p>

<p>The room closed around her
with its familiar colors and
furnishings. Sometimes she
would dream that she was
elsewhere, unfamiliar, ugly
places, but then she would
awaken to the four long windows
with their coarse beige
drapes of monk's cloth and
the fantasies were forever dispelled.</p>

<p>Her eyes loved the two
paintings, the dark curls of
the pink-and-white doll sitting
prissily atop the dresser,
and the full-length mirror on
the open closet door.</p>

<p>The pictured design of the
wallpaper, its background
merging with the pastel blue
of the slanted ceiling.... Almost
as they had blended together
that first day when she
was twelve. Yet not the same,
she corrected her thoughts,
frowning. Sometimes, as today,
the design seemed faded
and changed. The gay little
bridges and the flowered, impossibly
blue trees seemed to
change and threaten to vanish.</p>

<p>She laughed over at the demurely
sitting doll. Essie had
been her favorite doll when
she was younger. Of course
now that she was fourteen
she did not play with dolls
any more. But it was permissible
that she keep her old
friend neatly dressed and ever
at hand as a confidant. She
smiled at the thought. Essie
never tattled.</p>

<p>"It must be from that polio,"
she told Essie, knowing
all the time that she was almost
well now and needed
plenty of rest and careful
doses of exercise. "It makes
my eyes&mdash;funny."</p>

<p>Essie smiled back glassily
and Ruth laughed. It was
good to awaken and see the
thick black arms of the maple
tree outside the windows. It
was good to have the cool
green leaves waving at her,
and see the filtered dapplings
of sunshine cross and recross
them.</p>

<p>She loved that old tree. She
had played among its long
horizontal branches from
childhood. Her brother, Alex,
who had been killed in the
Normandy Landing during
World War Three, had loved
the tree too. He had built the
railed, shingled-roofed little
nest high up in the tree's
crotched heart where Ruth
kept some of her extra-special
notes and jewelry and a book
of poems.</p>

<p>One of the two paintings on
the bedroom walls was of the
old tree. The tree dominated
the old story-and-a-half white
house with the green shutters
that was the Halseys' home.
Her home. Alex had painted
that picture as well as the other
showing the graceful loop
of the river and the roofs of
the village of Thayer in the
distance. Ruth had been with
him as he painted that second
picture from the jutting rock
ledge five hundred feet above
the river.</p>

<p>"I was just ten then, Essie,"
she chirped gaily. "I remember
how afraid I was of
the height and how Alex
scolded."</p>

<p>But Alex was dead now and
all she had to remember of
him was the paintings and the
photographs that Mother kept
in a battered brown leather
folder. For a moment the
bright sunlight in her beloved
maple tree's leaves seemed to
dim and the room wavered
about her. She wondered
about that. She must tell her
father or her mother.</p>

<p>Perhaps the polio, light
touch of it or not, had hurt
her eyesight. Glasses! She
shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>The room shimmered and
blurred&mdash;and suddenly broke
apart to reform into something.... She
squinched her
eyes shut to the hideous vision.
And then opened them
the merest slit.</p>

<p>Nothing had changed....</p>

<p>"MOTHER!" she cried.
"Daddy!" she cried. "What
has happened?"</p>

<p>She heard the door to&mdash;to
this hideous travesty of a
room opening. Her eyes darted
around the shrunken metal-walled
shell, even the ceiling
curved overhead, and she saw
two grotesque daubs taped to
the walls that parodied the
paintings of her dead brother
Alex. The coloring was ugly
and the proportions out of
line. And it was not canvas
but curling sheets of paper
taped and painted to resemble
frames!</p>

<p>A big man, sandy-haired
and with vertical wrinkles
deep between piercing blue
eyes, came into the room. She
shrank into the bed, seeing
that the sheet she tugged taut
across her breast was ragged
and blue.</p>

<p>"Ruth," he said, a slow
smile making his face almost
handsome, "you're better.
You haven't spoken in
weeks."</p>

<p>Ruth wanted to giggle. As
though they could keep her
quiet. Daddy was always
shushing her.... But who was
this big man in his dusty
drab coveralls and dropped
dust mask dangling upon his
chest?</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Dear?
It's Buhl, your husband."</p>

<p>Buhl was fifteen and only
a couple of inches taller than
Ruth. Of course he had sandy
hair like this man. But this
man was old enough to be
Buhl's father. This was crazy&mdash;like
one of the dreams that
always made her unhappy.</p>

<p>So? So it was a dream. She
felt warmth and release. Why
not see what this dream had
to offer that might be amusing
to remember and tell
Buhl sometime soon.
Wouldn't he laugh when he
heard she had dreamed about
him? And been married to
him.</p>

<p>She saw the strip of shiny
metal that masqueraded as her
mirror, and where her four
long windows, with their
thick, loose-woven drapes,
had been there were only four
taped strips of paper with
crude pictures of draped windows
daubed on them. There
were even green dabs of paint
and black splashes to stimulate
her beloved maple tree.</p>

<p>"Ruth! Do you feel better
now? Please don't smile at me
like that. I know you loved
the baby, but this Martian atmosphere
is tough even for
men. It wasn't your fault."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and talk," Ruth
laughed gaily. "This is just
another bad dream and I
know it. I'll wake up in a little
while and be back in my
cool old room."</p>

<p>"Blast your room and your
dreams!"</p>

<p>The man went across the
room in a swift rush and tore
down one of the false windows,
the painted strip of paper.
And beyond, through a
dusty oval glass window,
Ruth could see a reddish
brown wasteland, where dust
clouds spun and shifted slowly,
and a dusty huddle of
what looked like quonset
huts or storage sheds of metal.</p>

<p>"That is reality, Ruth. You
must face it. This pretense,
this sleazy imitation of your
old room is wrong. You're
strong enough, and I love you&mdash;you
can accept truth."</p>

<p>His face changed, all expression
sponged from it in
an instant as he looked into
her eyes, and then it seemed
to dissolve into something
ugly and yet childish. She
saw tears burst through and
furrow the dust on his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Dear Lord," he cried, almost
reverently, "must this go
on forever? Will she ever
come back to me?"</p>

<p>His voice choked off and he
stumbled across the room and
out the door. She heard it shut
behind him, and she was hunting
for Essie, already having
forgotten the ill-mannered intruder.</p>

<p>There was no Essie, only a
mannikin of cloth-stuffed
white nylon and lipstick, with
black nylon for hair.</p>

<p>And then the room shimmered
and broke apart and reformed
and she was back in
her bed with the sun on the
slowly dancing green leaves
outside the four long windows.
Essie was smiling down
at her from the dresser, and
the paintings were as always,
soft colors and perfectly
drafted.</p>

<p>Had she thought there were
four windows? How silly of
her. The second from the
right was a small oval of glass,
or rather, a glass-covered picture
of desert scene. Odd that
she had forgotten about that
picture. Oh well, what did it
matter.</p>

<p>In a few days she would be
well enough again to climb
out on the giant limbs and
into the tree nest that her
brother, Alex, had built. And
the boys would come to see
her and take her to the drugstore
for sodas and sundaes.</p>

<p>Yes, she was sure now. She
<i>did</i> like Buhl Austin best....</p>
